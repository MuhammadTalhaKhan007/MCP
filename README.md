## 🚀 Overview

This project is a Python-based implementation of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — an open protocol for enabling agents to collaborate with tools, memory, and data sources.

It uses the official [Anthropic Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) and supports local agent workflows through the `mcp` CLI interface.

Whether you're experimenting with autonomous agents or building LLM-based assistants, this repo offers a fast way to get started with **Agentic AI**.
